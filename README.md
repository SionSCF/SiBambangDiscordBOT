# Si Bambang Discord BOT

Si Bambang is a Discord BOT developed by Bambang Ketupat using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). It is intended to be an AIO bot that does everything from welcoming newcomers to informing the server when a streamer goes LIVE, playing music, and everything. Si Bambang will not be publicly released, however this repository will be here for others to use if they want to develop their own bots.
